Project Name :- FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM SOFTWARE

INTRODUCTION:

To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast Principal Component Analysis has used to recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy rate. The matched face is used to mark attendance of the employee. Our system maintains the attendance records of employees automatically.Face recognition is an important application of Image processing owing to its use in many fields. Identification of individuals in an organization for the purpose of attendance is one such application of face recognition.Maintenance and monitoring of attendance records plays a vital role in the analysis of performance of any organization.

The purpose of developing attendance management systemis to computerize the traditional way of taking attendance. Automated Attendance Management System performs the daily activities of attendance marking and analysis with reduced human intervention. The prevalent techniques and methodologies for detecting and recognizing face fail to overcome issues such as scaling, pose, illumination, variations,rotation, and occlusions.

ABSTRACT

Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in performance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for security and commercial applications.

An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for a college to mark the attendance of their students. To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast principal Component Analysis has used to recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy rate.

The matched face is used to mark attendance of the student. Our system maintains the attendance records of students automatically. Manual entering of attendance in logbooks
becomes a difficult task and it also wastes the time. So we designed an efficient module that comprises of face recognition to manage the attendance records of students.

Proposed System :

 The system consists of a camera that captures the images of the students and sends it to the image enhancement module. After enhancement the image comes in the Face 45 Detection and Recognition modules and then the attendance is marked on the excel sheet.

Advantages - 

• Reduces paperwork and saves time.
• Eliminates duplicate data entries.
• Easy attendance recording.
• Increased privacy and security where student cannot present himself or his friend while they are not.Reduces manual process errors and provides a reliable attendance system

Existing System :

 Every institute has its own method in this regard. Some are taking attendance manually using the old paper or file based approach and some have adopted methods of automatic attendance using some biometric techniques.

 Disadvanatages -

 Attendance registers are prone to damage and being misplaces.
 It is very time consuming process.
 Inconsistency in data.
 More Complexity

 Requirement Specification:
