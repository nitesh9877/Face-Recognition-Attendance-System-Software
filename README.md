INTRODUCTION
To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast Principal Component Analysis has used to
recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy rate. The matched face is used to
mark attendance of the employee. Our system maintains the attendance records of employees
automatically.

Face recognition is an important application of Image processing owing to its use in many fields.
Identification of individuals in an organization for the purpose of attendance is one such
application of face recognition. Maintenance and monitoring of attendance records plays a vital
role in the analysis of performance of any organization. The purpose of developing attendance
management system is to computerize the traditional way of taking attendance. Automated

with reduced human intervention. The prevalent techniques and methodologies for detecting and
recognizing face fail to overcome issues such as scaling, pose, illumination, variations, rotation,
and occlusions.
