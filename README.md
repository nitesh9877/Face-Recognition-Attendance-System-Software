IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AN ATTENDANCE SYSTEM FOR A LECTURE, SECTION OR LABORATORY BY WHICH LECTURERS OR TEACHING ASSISTANT CAN RECORD STUDENTS ATTENDANCE. IT SAVES TIME AND EFFORT ,ESPECIALLY IF IT IS LECTURE WITH HUGE NO. OF STUDENT. AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ENVISIONED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE DRAWBACK IN THE TRADITIONAL(MANUAL) SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM CAN NOT ONLY MERELY HELP IN THE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM, BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE GOOD WILL OF AN INSTITUTION.
